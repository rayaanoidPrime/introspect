This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Motivation

This contains the self-hosted agents front-end and back-end that we have created for our enterprise users. It will help them:

1. Access our service from their own system
2. Let admin users add and manage general users
3. Let admin users connect to a data warehouse and add tables

## Running without a security certificate

If you are running this locally or on the intranet, you can leave `dockerfile.agents-nginx` unchanged. But if deploying this on the internet and with an SSL certificate, you should modify `dockerfile.agents-nginx` so it uses `nginx/nginx_prod.conf` as its nginx config. You should also uncomment the lines for copying the certificate and private key.

## Docker

To run the docker containers, make sure you have docker running on your system.

(only needed if you have to export the frontend to static files)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run export
```

On Linux/Mac

```bash
docker compose up --no-attach agents-nginx
```

On Windows

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the containers are running, you can access the front end app at `localhost:1234`

## Username and password

The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.

## Internals

`backend/docker-setup-files` contains the files for the initial setup for the backend + the db: supervisor confs, rabbitmq installation, startup bash script to start supervisor processes, and nginx config to redirect the partykit websocket requests to the right port.

A note about the partykit server: I couldn't connect to the websocket directly on port `1999`, which is where the partykit server runs.

So I had to also open port `2000`, make an nginx that redirects `http://localhost:2000` to `ws://localhost:1999`, and connect to that port on the front end instead. You can notice this in the `.env.local` file.

## Testing Locally

The following sections explain how to test portions of the different containers locally. This could be helpful when debugging.

### Running Agents App Locally

This project requires Node.js. If you don't have it, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).

First, install the npm dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) with your browser to see the result. Note that full functionality will not be available unless the backend is also running.

### Testing the UI

We use [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test the UI. The tests are located in `test-ui/`. To run the tests you can directly run the following command:

```bash
# run this from the root folder, not from the test-ui folder
# if first time running, install playwright:
npx playwright install
# then run the tests:
npx playwright test
# or in UI mode (useful for debugging)
npx playwright test --ui
```

This command will start all of the docker containers (if not already running) via [start-containers.sh](test-ui/start-containers.sh) and then run the tests. This is to spin up the full app and enable our tests to verify the end-to-end behavior (including the backend). If you're adding new containers to or removing any containers from our [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), please update the expected container count in [start-containers.sh](test-ui/start-containers.sh) to ensure that our container script expects the right number of containers.

After you are done testing, you can run the following command to stop all of the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Test Structure

Each test file `*.spec.js` should correspond with a route or some component of the UI. Once the test is done, it will output the results in the `test-results` folder, with a highly readable HTML output served at a custom port. You can view the results by opening the HTML file in your browser.

#### VSCode Debugging

You can also install the playwright extension for VSCode and debug the tests from there.

#### Codegen for Tests

You can use the following command to generate the playwright code from a set of recorded actions on the actual UI:

```sh
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:1234
```

## Build Docker Images

To begin, export the frontend assets:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run export
```

Next, build the docker images:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-build.yaml build
```

Note that docker-compose-build.yaml is used only for building the images and doesn't contain any runtime configurations (e.g. ports, volumes, networks, environment variables etc). It also uses `dockerfile.agents-python-server-export` which doesn't mount the local backend directory as a volume. This is because we will not have the backend directory in our customers' systems.

Finally, tag and push the images to the registry (https://hub.docker.com/repositories/defogai):

```bash
docker tag defog-self-hosted-agents-postgres defogai/agents-postgres:latest
docker tag defog-self-hosted-agents-python-server defogai/agents-python-server:latest
docker tag defog-self-hosted-agents-nginx defogai/agents-nginx:latest

docker push defogai/agents-postgres:latest
docker push defogai/agents-python-server:latest
docker push defogai/agents-nginx:latest
```

### Run Exported Docker Images

As before, remember to make a copy of the `.env.template`, rename it to `.env`, and replace the placeholders with the actual values.

To run the exported images, you would need to use a different compose file, namely `docker-compose-hub.yaml`. This file does not contain the build steps, but only the image links (to our defogai docker repository), and is used to run the built images from the repository. You can run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-hub.yaml up -d
```

Our repositories for the images are:

- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/defogai/agents-nginx/general
- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/defogai/agents-python-server/general
- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/defogai/agents-postgres/general

When distributing the composed image, customers only need the `docker-compose-hub.yaml` and the `.env.template` files. They can then rename the `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in the required values. The `docker-compose-hub.yaml` file can be used to pull the built images and start the containers.
