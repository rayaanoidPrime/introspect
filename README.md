This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Motivation

This contains the self-hosted agents front-end and back-end that we have created for our enterprise users. It will help them:

1. Access our service from their own system
2. Let admin users add and manage general users
3. Let admin users connect to a data warehouse and add tables

## Running without a security certificate

If you are running this locally or on the intranet, you can leave `dockerfile.agents-nginx` unchanged. But if deploying this on the internet and with an SSL certificate, you should modify `dockerfile.agents-nginx` so it uses `nginx/nginx_prod.conf` as its nginx config. You should also uncomment the lines for copying the certificate and private key.

## Docker

To run the docker containers, make sure you have docker running on your system.

(only needed if you have to export the frontend to static files)

```bash
cd frontend && npm run export
```

On Linux/Mac

```bash
docker compose up --no-attach agents-nginx
```

On Windows

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the containers are running, you can access the front end app at `localhost:1234`

## Username and password

The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.

## Internals

`backend/docker-setup-files` contains the files for the initial setup for the backend + the db: supervisor confs, rabbitmq installation, startup bash script to start supervisor processes, and nginx config to redirect the partykit websocket requests to the right port.

A note about the partykit server: I couldn't connect to the websocket directly on port `1999`, which is where the partykit server runs.

So I had to also open port `2000`, make an nginx that redirects `http://localhost:2000` to `ws://localhost:1999`, and connect to that port on the front end instead. You can notice this in the `.env.local` file.

## Testing Locally

The following sections explain how to test portions of the different containers locally. This could be helpful when debugging.

### Running Agents App Locally

This project requires Node.js. If you don't have it, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).

First, install the npm dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) with your browser to see the result. Note that full functionality will not be available unless the backend is also running.

### Testing the UI

We use [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test the UI. The tests are located in `test-ui/`. To run the tests you can directly run the following command:

```bash
# run this from the root folder, not from the test-ui folder
# if first time running, install playwright:
npx playwright install
# then run the tests:
npx playwright test
# or in UI mode (useful for debugging)
npx playwright test --ui
```

This command will start all of the docker containers (if not already running) via [start-containers.sh](test-ui/start-containers.sh) and then run the tests. This is to spin up the full app and enable our tests to verify the end-to-end behavior (including the backend). If you're adding new containers to or removing any containers from our [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), please update the expected container count in [start-containers.sh](test-ui/start-containers.sh) to ensure that our container script expects the right number of containers.

After you are done testing, you can run the following command to stop all of the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Test Structure

Each test file `*.spec.js` should correspond with a route or some component of the UI. Once the test is done, it will output the results in the `test-results` folder, with a highly readable HTML output served at a custom port. You can view the results by opening the HTML file in your browser.

#### VSCode Debugging

You can also install the playwright extension for VSCode and debug the tests from there.

#### Codegen for Tests

You can use the following command to generate the playwright code from a set of recorded actions on the actual UI:

```sh
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:1234
```

## Build Docker Images

To begin, export the frontend assets:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run export
```

As it's highly likely that our customers are working on a different platform (e.g. windows) from ours (macs), we need to build multi-platform images. To do so, you would need to install and setup buildx to build multi-architecture images. You can read more about buildx [here](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/). For now, install buildx and create a new builder:

```bash
# install buildx
docker buildx install
# create a new builder
docker buildx create --name mybuilder
docker buildx use mybuilder
```

Next, build the docker images. To build and push each image individually, here are the commands:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -f dockerfile.agents-python-server-export -t defogai/agents-python-server:latest --push .
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -f dockerfile.agents-nginx -t defogai/agents-nginx:latest --push .
```

Note that whatever you build and push with will overwrite past builds with the same tag. E.g. if the previous build on latest had support for linux and windows and your latest build locally was only for linux, then the windows build will be lost after the latest push from your local build.

### Run Exported Docker Images

Please refer to the instructions in [defog-docker](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-docker) to run the exported docker images.

When changing substantial parts of the docker-compose.yaml in this repo, please also make sure to update the docker-compose.yaml in defog-docker accordingly.

## Dev Settings

You can make a copy of the `.vscode/settings_template.json` file and name it `.vscode/settings.json`. Feel free to override the default settings for this project as per your development needs and preferences.
