#  🔬 Defog Introspect: Deep Research for your internal data

Introspect is a service that does data-focused deep research for structured data. It understands your structured data (databases or CSV/Excel files), unstructured data (PDFs), and can query the web to get additional context.

## Demo
- Interactive Demo: https://demo.defog.ai/reports (user id: `admin`, password: `admin`)
- [150s video](https://www.loom.com/share/ed2017d503ce4335909f47e8629a3acb)

## Quick Start

1. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Create a .env file in your root folder
# You need all 3 - not just one
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

2. Start all services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. Access the application in your browser:
   - Main application: http://localhost:80
   - Standalone Backend API: http://localhost:1235

## How it works

We use a simple AI agent with tool use. An LLM attempts to answer a user question with 3 tools – `text_to_sql`, `web_search`, and `pdf_with_citations`.

The model then recursively asks questions using one of these tools until it is satisfied that it has enough context to answer the users question. By default, we use `o3-mini` for text to SQL, `gemini-2.0-flash` for web search, and `claude-3-7-sonnet` for both PDF analysis and orchestration.

## Development

For development workflows and more detailed instructions, see the README files in the `/backend` and `/frontend` directories.

## Supported Databases

Defog supports most database connectors including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks – and also includes support for CSV and Excel files.

## Build/Test/Lint Commands

### Backend (Python)
- Run all tests: `docker exec introspect-backend pytest`
- Run single test: `docker exec introspect-backend pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function -v`
- Tests use the `agents-postgres` service for database operations
- Create admin user: `docker exec introspect-backend python create_admin_user.py`

### Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Development server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Build production: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Export static site: `cd frontend && npm run export`
- Run frontend tests: `cd frontend && npx playwright test`
- Lint (Prettier): `cd frontend && npm run lint`

## To do
- [ ] Create Docs
- [ ] Let users choose what model they want for which task from the `.env. file
- [ ] Docs and examples for how to add custom tools
- [ ] Docs and exampels for how to integrate with unstructured data sources with search, like Google Drive and OneDrive
